# NIOSII-Core
This test the NIOS core processor provide by Intel FPGA 
This simple project test NIOS II core with avalon bus interface. 
I created a customized IPs called apexRegister_avalon_interface. 
This register store the data written by the C application running on NIOS II core via alavon data bus. 
Nios II is a 32-bit embedded processor architecture designed specifically for Altera familiy of FPGA. 
In this project, EP4CE30F23C7 is chosen as the FPGA to host the program to do the chip verfication.
The required IDE is Quartus II prime from Intel/Altera
